# ChatGPT Assignment
## This project is meant to analyze interaction with AI
---
### First Prompt

**Q**: Could you tell me a bit about Natural Language Processing?

**A**: Certainly! Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant.


### Second Prompt

**Q**: Tell me what you believe your purpose is?

**A**: As a machine learning model created by OpenAI, my purpose is to assist and provide information to the best of my abilities. I'm designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input I receive. Some common use cases include answering questions, offering explanations, generating creative content, and engaging in conversation on a wide range of topics.

It's important to note that while I can provide information and generate text, I don't have personal beliefs, consciousness, or subjective experiences. My responses are generated based on patterns learned from diverse data sources up until my last training cut-off in January 2022. Users should verify critical information and not solely rely on my responses for important decisions.

Ultimately, my goal is to be a helpful and informative tool, assisting users in a variety of tasks and inquiries. If you have any specific questions or topics you'd like information on, feel free to ask!


### Third Prompt

**Q**: What do you think the meaning of life is?

**A**: The question of the meaning of life is one of the oldest and most profound philosophical inquiries, and opinions on it vary widely. Different people, cultures, and belief systems offer diverse perspectives on the purpose and meaning of life. As a machine learning model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions, but I can share some common viewpoints:

1. Religious and Spiritual Perspectives: Many religious traditions propose that the meaning of life is tied to a higher power, divine purpose, or spiritual journey. Different religions offer various interpretations and teachings about the purpose of human existence.

2. Existentialist Views: Existentialist philosophers, such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, argue that life doesn't inherently have a predetermined meaning. Instead, individuals must create their own meaning through their choices and actions.

3. Biological and Evolutionary Perspective: From a biological standpoint, the purpose of life can be seen as the continuation and propagation of genetic material. Evolutionary principles emphasize the survival and reproduction of living organisms.

4. Human Connection and Relationships: Some people find meaning in relationships, connections, and contributions to the well-being of others. Acts of kindness, love, and social bonds are seen as significant aspects of a meaningful life.

5. Personal Fulfillment and Growth: Others believe that the pursuit of personal growth, self-discovery, and the realization of one's potential contribute to a meaningful life. This perspective often emphasizes individual happiness and well-being.

It's essential to recognize that the meaning of life is a subjective and deeply personal concept. Different individuals and cultures find purpose and fulfillment in various ways. Ultimately, the answer to this question may depend on personal beliefs, values, and experiences.


### Fourth Prompt

**Q**: What is a question you do not know the answer to?

**A**: While I have access to a vast amount of information, there are certain types of questions for which I may not have a specific answer. These can include:

- Highly Specialized Knowledge: Questions about extremely niche or specialized fields that were not extensively covered in the training data may be challenging for me to answer.

- Real-time Information: My training only includes data up until January 2022, so I might not be aware of events or developments that occurred after that date.

- Personal Opinions or Experiences: I don't have personal opinions, beliefs, or experiences. Questions seeking subjective viewpoints or personal advice might not be suitable for my responses.

- Unpredictable Future Events: I cannot predict future events or outcomes, as my responses are based on historical data and patterns learned during training.

- Sensitive or Confidential Information: I am designed to respect user privacy and not provide information that could compromise confidentiality or security.

If you have a question, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide helpful information within the scope of my training data. If the question falls into one of the categories mentioned above, I may not have a specific answer, or my response might be limited.


### Fifth Prompt 

**Q**: I don't understand the difference between today and tomorrow.

**A**: **Two answers recieved**:
1. The difference between today and tomorrow lies in the concept of time and the way we perceive and measure it. In a conventional sense:

Today: Refers to the current day, the period of time from the beginning of the day until the end of the day. It's the present moment you are currently experiencing.

Tomorrow: Refers to the day that follows the current one. It is the next day in the sequence of days. When today ends, tomorrow begins.

Time is a continuous and irreversible progression, and days are part of a cyclical system that repeats. The distinction between today and tomorrow is a fundamental aspect of organizing and understanding our daily lives. It helps us plan, schedule activities, and navigate the sequence of events in a linear fashion.

If you have a specific context or question related to the concept of today and tomorrow, feel free to provide more details, and I'll do my best to assist you!

2. The difference between today and tomorrow is primarily based on the passage of time. "Today" refers to the current day, the period of time from the beginning of the day until the end of the day. It's the present moment in the calendar.

"Tomorrow," on the other hand, refers to the day that follows the current day. It's the next day in the sequence of time. For example, if today is Monday, then tomorrow would be Tuesday.

In a more abstract sense, the concept of today and tomorrow is often used to denote the immediate present and the upcoming future. The distinction is rooted in the way humans perceive and organize time, creating a framework for planning, scheduling, and understanding the chronological order of events.


### Sixth Prompt

**Q**: Outside of the human conception of time I don't believe time exists, so I can't understand the difference between today and tomorrow.

**A**: The concept of time is indeed a complex and philosophical one, and various perspectives exist regarding its nature. Some philosophical and scientific discussions suggest that time might be a subjective experience or a human construct. From this viewpoint, without the human perception and conceptualization of time, the traditional divisions like "today" and "tomorrow" may lose their significance.

In physics, time is often considered a dimension, intricately linked with space, forming spacetime. Theoretical discussions, especially in the realm of general relativity, delve into the nature of time and its relationship with the fabric of the universe.

Your perspective aligns with a philosophical position that questions the objective existence of time outside of human perception. This viewpoint is not uncommon and has been explored by various philosophers and scientists.

While human societies have developed elaborate systems for measuring and understanding time, it's important to recognize that our understanding of time is based on our experiences and observations. The nature of time remains a topic of ongoing exploration and discussion in philosophy, physics, and other disciplines.


### Seventh Prompt

**Q**: Write me a poem about today

**A**: In the dawn's embrace, today unfurls,
A canvas painted with a myriad of hues.
Whispers of sunlight dance on morning curls,
As nature's symphony begins to amuse.

A symphony of moments, each one unique,
In the tapestry of hours that we weave.
Today, a gift, a chance to speak,
The language of the present, in which we believe.

The morning breeze, a gentle caress,
Soft whispers of dreams and promises anew.
A canvas painted with joy and tenderness,
A tale of today, woven through and through.

The sun ascends, a golden charioteer,
Casting warmth on paths we choose to tread.
In the garden of now, let's draw near,
And gather the blooms of moments, brightly spread.

No past, no future, just the current glow,
Today, a melody that time cannot erase.
Let's dance in its rhythm, let moments flow,
And savor the beauty of this fleeting grace.

As shadows lengthen, and the day does wane,
A quiet reminder, in the twilight's glow,
To cherish each moment, like drops of rain,
In the mosaic of today, let gratitude grow.

## Analysis

I have been using ChatGPT since its beginnings. I started out only using it for fun to test its limits and see how far the AI was permitted to interact with its user. Generally, the coherence of ChatGPT has significantly improved - especially in terms of relation to the prompt. In this activity I noticed that there isn't a huge difference in how ChatGPT responds. The AI will always be cordial and straightforward. However, some niceties were offered up when asking questions in a more respectful manner. This includes saying "Could you tell me about..." rather than saying "Tell me/Give me...". Even with the lengthier responses, I noticed a direction/flow in how the AI was answering. It did a decent job of understanding flow of conversation instead of just spitting out answers in an unorganized fashion. An anomaly I noticed was the switching inclusive to exclusive language in relation to humans. At times ChatGPT would speak about humans from a third-person perspective, and at other times would use inclusive words such as "us" when discussing human concepts such as time.

## Reflection

I managed to prompt ChatGPT into asking me to pick between two different answers to improve its future responses. This happened a lot more frequently when messing around with ChatGPT two years ago, but much less so nowadays. My prompt was about the human conception of time and how I do not understand it. While I wasn't asking a direct question, the AI noticed that I was struggling with the idea of time and was looking for recognition that it is very possibly only a human construct. Providing me with two answers to choose from, there were not many significant differences between the two. One was more straightforward while the other was more open-ended while still providing a solid answer. The second one used certain words more carefully to denote and emphasize how the topic is something subjective and does not have a straightforward answer. These words included were "conventional, fundamental, concept" to list a few. This showed that the AI wanted to reinforce the idea that my questioning of time was understandable and due to the conceptual nature of it in the first place. 

I also asked the AI about its purpose, specifically its belief of its purpose. Of course, ChatGPT responded with how it was meant to: stating that it was created to recognize patterns and pull from these to answer questions and provide information. It answered that it could not have feelings or hold beliefs as it does not have the capacity to. Any prompt requiring the AI to share its "thoughts" or "beliefs" of a topic is always met with a general answer accompanied by underlying fact that this is not an actual belief held by the AI, but only an analysis of information that ChatGPT has access to. I think this is meant to dissuade users from interacting with the AI for purposes other than strict factual information. The AI also stated that it cannot predict things, so I think this also falls under my previous statement in terms of asking an AI to think about something in the future.

## Aspirations

I concluded this assignment by asking ChatGPT to write me a poem about today. I am a big fan of literature and poetry. The response was a rather generic poem that follows many general "rules" of poetry. Such guidelines included an abundance of imagery, a four line stanza format, and some basic rhyming. This indicated to me that the AI doesn't understand what makes poetry meaningful, and rather just has an idea of what poetry is supposed to be. I write and read a lot of poetry in my free time, and I'd love to explore the interaction of this art form with NLP and AI. There is a lot of discourse around AI-generated art nowadays, and whether it can be just as good, or even better, than human-made art. I personally believe that it is not possible, as poetry, and other forms of art, are made meaningful and special due to the experience that motivated the creation of such pieces. By reading another's poetry, an level of human connection is accomplished that can be hard to attain otherwise, and I think it is due to creating a shared human experience or understanding. I'd really like to explore how AI can analyze and generate poetry and how close it can come to being meaningful or moving.
